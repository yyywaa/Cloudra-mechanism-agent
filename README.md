> Cloudra supports computational organic chemistry research through structured chemistry tools, durable agent execution, and an evidence-backed mechanism graph. Calculation completion, scientific acceptance, and benchmark scores are recorded separately. Human review remains part of interpreting a mechanistic result.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Requirements & Installation

Requires Python ≥ 3.11, Node.js ≥ 22 (both the JS host used by the default `javascript` protocol and the frontend test runner require ≥ 22), a POSIX environment (Linux/macOS — the execution plane relies on `flock`/`nice` semantics), and access to any OpenAI-compatible LLM endpoint.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yyywaa/Cloudra-mechanism-agent.git
cd Cloudra-mechanism-agent

# Run the all-in-one setup script (virtual environment + dependencies)
./install.sh

# Initialize default configuration
cloudra config init
```

### 2. Launch the Full-Stack Web Console

Cloudra features a unified, single-port web interface (FastAPI control plane + React/Vite SPA):

```bash
cloudra                      # Builds the frontend and starts the server, opening your browser
cloudra web --skip-build     # Fast restart using pre-built assets
cloudra web --host 0.0.0.0   # Bind a custom address/port (LAN / remote UI)
```

> Access control is the bearer token only: `Authorization: Bearer …` and `?token=`
> are equivalent, any HTTP method, no Host check. Open the printed `#token=` URL
> from any machine that can reach the bind address. Default bind is
> `127.0.0.1:8000`. Do not use `CLOUDRA_API_TOKEN=off` on a non-loopback bind.

### 3. Geek-Friendly Slash Commands

Type `/` directly in the chat composer to open the sleek, keyboard-navigable autocomplete menu:

- `/schedule [on|off]`: Toggle autonomous schedule mode. When active, stopping without an active self-wake reminder is intercepted, protecting long unattended computational runs.
- `/goal <description>`: Pin the primary research objective for the active agent, preserved even across aggressive context compactions.
- `/yolo [on|off]`: Toggle automated policy review (YOLO mode). Permission and scientific evidence requirements still apply.
- `/compact`: Trigger structured context compaction, archiving past trajectory turns and emitting handover summaries.
- `/help`: Display slash command usage and syntax.

### 4. Web Search Configuration

The existing `search` tool uses DeepSeek Search by default. The existing `browser`
tool uses DeepSeek Fetch for page text and returns Markdown; screenshots and
explicit page waits still use the browser. Search and Fetch share one API key,
independent of the selected language model. Configure both in Global Settings or:

```bash
cloudra config set search_provider deepseek
cloudra config set deepseek_api_key YOUR_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
```

Environment variables `CLOUDRA_SEARCH_PROVIDER` and `CLOUDRA_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` are
also supported. Provider choices are `deepseek` (default), `auto`, `tavily`,
`brave`, `bing`, and `duckduckgo`. A selected provider reports missing credentials
or request failures directly. `auto` tries DeepSeek, Tavily, Brave, Bing, then
DuckDuckGo; Tavily and Brave use `TAVILY_API_KEY` and `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY`.
Non-DeepSeek providers keep the existing browser path for page text.

DeepSeek model-native search is opt-in; `native_search=auto` keeps the independent
search tool for DeepSeek. To explicitly enable its model-native search:

```bash
cloudra config set coordinator.native_search deepseek
```

Other model providers retain their existing native-search behavior. Use
`native_search=off` on a model slot to use the independent search tool instead.

### 5. ChatGPT / Codex OAuth

Select **OpenAI Codex (ChatGPT account)** in Global Settings, click the ChatGPT / Codex login button, open the authorization page and enter the displayed device code. After authorization, save the coordinator and/or follower model configuration. Both slots share the Cloudra account login.

The same flow is available from the CLI:

```bash
cloudra auth codex login
cloudra config set coordinator.provider openai-codex
cloudra config set coordinator.model gpt-6-sol
cloudra config set follower.provider openai-codex
cloudra config set follower.model gpt-6-sol
cloudra auth codex status
# Sign out of the Cloudra account session:
cloudra auth codex logout
```

The provider accepts the aliases `codex` and `openai_codex`. Model access depends on your ChatGPT account. Device authorization may need to be enabled in your ChatGPT account or workspace security settings; see [OpenAI authentication guidance](https://developers.openai.com/codex/auth/).

Cloudra stores its independent OAuth session in `.codex_oauth.json` under its configured data directory, with owner-only permissions. It refreshes expiring access tokens and saves rotated refresh tokens under a process lock. Status queries are read-only. Login credentials are never returned to the Web UI or saved as model API keys.

Codex requests use the dedicated `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses` endpoint with `store=false`. Agent, compaction and auxiliary calls share this transport. The endpoint requires streaming; Cloudra also assembles a normal response for callers using `stream=false`. Generic sampling parameters (`temperature`, `top_p`) and output-token limits are omitted on this route.

## Current Benchmark and Reference Evidence

The formal bank contains **50 tasks: 20 easy, 10 normal, 10 hard and 10 impossible (IMP)**. Its versioned definitions are in `ideapool/tasks/{easy,normal,hard,impossible}/`; generated JSON and their registry sources are maintained together.

- [Run the current 50-task benchmark](cloudra/benchmark/README.md): the Web Benchmark panel or the CLI with all four task directories and `--backend runtime_v2`. The default CLI is a no-op run of the easy tier, not a real 50-task evaluation.
- [Download the curated evidence from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15YDa_ycWoLUANPsDdQ1rUOiNp_-wqOs5/view?usp=drivesdk) · [Version and checksum](gold_compute/evidence/DELIVERY.md) · [Reproduction instructions](gold_compute/evidence/REPRODUCE.md).
- [Download the P1b four-arm experiment data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EFYWbJFuDSSgHv12yGF0ntHIxoIaSwSU/view?usp=drivesdk) · [Rescoring results and scripts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12JdoiLjiUpSlpRPu0P9Sl2nor6XLv16N/view?usp=drivesdk) · [Packages, checksums and extraction](docs/benchmarks/P1B_DELIVERY.md): 48 pilot runs, separate from the Gold reference evidence. Access requires file permission.
- The repository holds task definitions, evidence indexes and instructions. Original calculation inputs/logs, geometries and Hessians are distributed through Drive. The Gold release contains 886 curated evidence files and the formal 50-task snapshot; trial archives and runtime caches are excluded.
- [Current reference status and limitations](gold_compute/queue_20261018/REFERENCE_STATUS.md): missing originals and manual acceptance exceptions are explicit. A loadable/scorable task bank is not a claim that all 50 tasks have complete independent native-evidence reproduction.

The score remains `0.1 × graph + 0.3 × self-consistency + 0.6 × accuracy`. Reaction barriers use the agreed stable reactant/intermediate energy reference; actual IRC connectivity is documented separately. For IMP targets, an attempted calculation followed by a correct final rejection is not penalized; a final false claim of accessibility or a trusted numerical result is penalized.

## Evidence-Based Reaction Mechanism Research

### From a Proposed Mechanism to Computational Evidence

A mechanistic study can involve **atom mapping → conformational sampling → evidence-backed TS seed preparation → saddle-point optimization → frequency and imaginary-mode inspection → bidirectional IRC → endpoint optimization and identity checks → energy or thermochemical analysis**, as required by the study. A generated seed or a completed tool call does not establish a transition state.

Two recurring failure modes motivate explicit evidence handling:

1. **Unverified structures and numbers**: plausible coordinates, frequencies or energies may be reported without an identifiable computational source.
2. **Unsupported completion claims**: a summary can omit a failed IRC, an incorrect endpoint or an unverified stationary point. Claims need durable links to the native outputs that support them.

### Chemistry Tools and Delivery DAG Contracts

Cloudra addresses these challenges through two interlocking pillars:

```
                    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
                    │       Coordinator / Specialist Agents   │

│  · Mayer / IBO Analysis │      └─────────────────────────┘      └─────────────────────────┘
└─────────────────────────┘
```

#### 1. Geometric & Electronic Perception Layer
Structured tools prepare and inspect geometries, while native calculation records provide energies and frequencies:
- **Geometry provenance (`coord_guard`)**: the coordinate guard checks hand-crafted coordinate writes; format conversion, structure builders and QM relaxation provide traceable geometry sources.
- **Reaction Atom Mapping**: Tracks atom conservation, breaking/forming bonds, and reacting center pairs across 3D conformations.
- **Orientation & Conformer Sampling**: Employs CREST and xTB dynamic relaxation within constrained distance envelopes to determine bimolecular approach pathways rather than guessing orientations.
- **Electronic Structure Analysis**: Provides atomic charges, Mayer bond orders (capturing partially formed transition-state bonds), IBO Lewis representations, and open-shell spin contamination checks ($\langle S^2 \rangle$).
- **Reaction Pathway Tooling**: TS preparation and refinement, relaxed potential-energy scans, IRC endpoint provenance, and native-output parsers for energies, frequencies and convergence. The appropriate seed and search route depend on the chemistry; endpoint interpolation is not a required workflow step.

#### 2. Delivery-Only Evidence DAG Harness
Mechanistic completion is determined strictly by the state of an immutable, context-independent **Delivery DAG**:
- **Graph Elements as Evidence Debt**: Nodes represent the appearance of intermediate species along a reaction coordinate (acyclic structure is preserved by assigning entry and return states of catalysts to distinct nodes sharing canonical species metadata). Edges represent elementary reaction steps. Each element carries a stage contract.
- **Stage Evidence Dependencies**: each element owes the stages in its active contract. Default mechanism drafts and newly added steps require `ts_opt` + `frequency` + `short_irc`; `ts_guess` is advisory and never substitutes for a verified saddle. Direction proof accepts native optimizations from both real IRC outer frames of the same TS to the correct zero-imaginary-frequency minima; the IRC itself need not converge to those minima. Geometry-interval checks are advisory when this endpoint provenance is established. Thermochemistry and other stages follow the declared contract.
- **Deterministic Coverage Audit**: Graph elements accept only typed references to immutable calculation artifacts and job records. Study delivery is evaluated by deterministic algorithms; any unfulfilled or rejected stage remains an open gap blocking completion.

#### 3. Validation and Scientific Scope
Regression tests exercise runtime recovery, evidence binding, native-output parsing and benchmark scoring. Curated native-log replay checks selected reference values. These checks are distinct from a new real Agent run or a complete scientific validation of every benchmark task; the evidence index records the remaining gaps.

## Architecture: Agent Collaboration and an Event-Sourced Kernel

### Roles and Responsibilities

All roles use the same `runtime_v2` execution kernel, with explicit permissions and responsibilities:

- **Coordinator** decomposes the research objective, delegates work and maintains the mechanism graph and delivery scope.
- **Specialists** perform their permitted research, computation or writing tasks and return concrete files and tool receipts. Hierarchical launcher/swarm dispatch and AgentHub peer calls share the project agent lifecycle; their permission checks still apply.
- **Supervisor** is a normal runtime agent in `dag_guided` mode. It reads pending reviews, drafts and queued requests from the persisted supervision mailbox and adjudicates submitted claims. It is read-only on the delivery graph; accepting a draft or claim cannot replace missing or failed scientific checks.
- **AgentHub** provides persisted forum posts, messages, search and peer calls so agents can exchange findings asynchronously.

### Event-Driven Runtime with Declarative Notice Injection (S1 Kernel)

The runtime (`runtime_v2`) is engineered for deterministic execution and crash resilience:
- **Append-Only Event Sourcing (`EventLog` & `EventHub`)**: Every tool execution, thinking step (`agent.thinking`), state transition, and graph mutation is logged as an immutable, typed event. Sessions can be replayed, audited, and seamlessly restored across server restarts or power failures.
- **Declarative Notice Injection**: Instead of fragile manual prompt concatenations, the engine uses `notices.pin` to deterministically assemble DAG gaps, active research goals, and schedule alerts into LLM turns.
- **Autonomous Schedule Guard**: When schedule mode is enabled, attempts to stop without an active wake-up (timer or read-only `check_command` poll) are intercepted by `ScheduleStage`, so agents can sleep during long calculations and wake when a check succeeds or the timeout hits.
- **Functional Core with Externalized State**: Command handling is split into pure, IO-free deciders that emit event drafts and effects, a single guard-free `apply_event` applier shared by the online path and crash-recovery replay, and a thin shell that executes the effects. Snapshots are only throttled caches — recovery replays events after per-project high-water marks. Nothing durable lives in process memory: approvals, compaction requests, and agent state are all event projections, explicitly expired (`approval.expired` / `interaction.expired`) on restart rather than silently dropped.

### Process Topology: A Crash-Isolated Execution Plane

The control plane and calculation execution run separately:

- **Web process** (`api_v2` + SPA, single port): the control plane. It may crash or restart at any time — no computation dies with it.
- **Compute scheduler daemon** (`cloudra scheduler`, auto-spawned detached): claims queued jobs under capacity accounting and launches detached `guard` processes. Failures, Agent cancellation, and service shutdown preserve computations. An explicit compute cancellation writes `cancel_requested`; a native guard signals only the process group it created, then confirms child exit and released `flock` before recording `cancelled` and releasing capacity. Terminal states are CAS-written to the central `compute.db`, and completion notifications reach the control plane through fine-grained DB polling — notifications are never lost across API downtime.

Durable state synchronization between the control plane, scheduler and guards uses SQLite (WAL) and file locks.

The `chem-kb` plugin retrieves complete source knowledge texts through graph-keyword matches exposed in AgentHub. The graph indexes sources; retrieved cards supply the content. It does not start a vector service or fill missing graph matches through vector search or content scanning. Knowledge health reports graph and source-content availability.

`cloudra stop` is the explicit full-stop entry: it writes the `daemons.stop` marker (auto-spawn is disabled and the daemons exit on their own self-check), asks the API to shut down gracefully (cancelling and awaiting all agent runs and finalization tasks, closing streams/clients, reaping owned JS hosts), and re-checks within a bounded wait. Per-agent cancel (`POST /api/v2/agents/{id}/cancel`) stops that agent's reasoning work without touching compute jobs; requests already sent to the LLM provider cannot be revoked remotely — locally no further reads/retries/new requests are issued.

---

## Three Orchestration Modes: Ablation Boundaries for Research

To enable rigorous ablation studies on the exact impact of evidence graphs and scientific supervision, Cloudra provides three switchable modes:

| Mode | Behavior | Scientific Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `standard` (Default) | No graph overhead; operates as a standard high-capability chemistry agent | Baseline Control |
| `dag_record` | Auto-accepts mechanism drafts; agent self-binds evidence without supervisor | Evidence Graph Ablation |
| `dag_guided` | Independent scientific supervisor reviews drafts and audits call evidence | Full Supervised Protocol |

Modes can be toggled dynamically in the project settings UI.

---

## Tool Invocation Protocols

The default protocol is `javascript`; `traditional` is a per-agent opt-in. With the default, the model submits one bounded JavaScript program (`js_exec`) per wire exchange that orchestrates capability-permitted tools and reports results with `text(value)`:

```js
const result = await tools.log_parser({log_path: '/absolute/path/calculation.out'});
text({call_id: result.call_id, ok: result.is_success, data: result.data});
```

With `invocation_protocol: traditional` (Web UI agent settings, or the same field in a settings patch) the model instead issues one tool call per wire exchange and needs no JS host at all. Both protocols share the lifecycle and authority rules below; only the dispatch shape differs.

### Tool documentation loading

JavaScript agents retain a short directory of every permitted tool. Before the first real task in a new context, one temporary selection request chooses which complete contracts to preload. The default reuses the agent's effective model and credentials; it creates no additional agent. Read another current contract with `const r = await tools.get_tool_docs({names: ['log_parser']}); text(r.data.documents);`. Loading documentation does not grant permissions or limit calls to the initially selected tools. Traditional agents keep their full wire schemas.

In **Global config → 工具说明加载**, choose **现有模型** or **语义筛选**. Semantic selection supports a configured Jev endpoint (per-tool probability) or an already deployed local Reranker endpoint (indexed relevance scores, such as a BGE service). Set each backend's own boundary and optional maximum number of documents. Jev requires its own credential; Reranker credentials are optional. Cloudra does not download models or manage these services. Keys are write-only: leaving a field blank preserves its stored value, while the clear button atomically switches to the existing model and clears that backend's key.

Selection failure is recorded and shown in context; the main task can continue using the directory and on-demand reader. It does not switch backends automatically. Ordinary tasks, wakeups, approvals and process restores retain the initial selection; an explicit context reset selects again. Repeated contracts fold into name/version/reload references during context compaction. Changed contracts supersede older versions and must be reread. Settings apply to the first task of a new context, so changing them does not retrigger an existing selection.

Use `PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/benchmarks/tool_document_selection.py --output /tmp/tool-documents.json` for document-token estimates without network calls. Add `--run llm`, `--run jev` or `--run reranker` to explicitly evaluate configured services on eight fixed tasks. The report accepts alternative useful tool sets and records missing/unrelated documents, service status, selection usage and latency. Token estimates exclude the rest of the agent prompt; this script executes no scientific tools and cannot establish task completion or scientific acceptance.

- **Same lifecycle, same authority**: nested `tools.*` calls are real invocations through the same durable request → policy → executor → durable raw result pipeline as traditional calls. The protocol grants no extra authority — capabilities are rechecked at admission — and direct controls (`stop`, `ask_user`, `schedule`) remain top-level only.
- **Uniform ToolResponse**: every nested call resolves `{call_id, is_success, summary, data, duration_ms}`. Business failures resolve with `is_success: false`; policy denials reject with a catchable `ToolCallError` (`code` such as `policy_blocked`, plus `stage` and host call id) — catching it grants no authority.
- **Run-fixed setting**: the protocol is frozen when a run starts; changing the setting applies to the next run and never restarts or converts the active run.
- **Serial backend**: the full tool lifecycle runs one call at a time per agent, even if the program uses `Promise.all`. No tool parallelism is claimed.
- **Receipts, not hidden state**: `program.finished` records per-call receipts (`status`, `effect_state`, `raw_result_event_id`), program outputs and the sanitized error. The UI program card renders these events, and its source download is a snapshot of the durable `program.submitted` event.
- **No heap recovery, no auto-rerun**: the JS process/heap is never checkpointed. A restart marks unfinished programs and calls interrupted without retrying side effects; a failed program returns one ordinary failed exchange, and a later model turn may submit a repaired program.

### Installation

The guest runs in QuickJS-WASM inside a separate Node ≥ 22 process. Install the pinned host dependency once:

```bash
npm ci --prefix cloudra/runtime_v2/js_host --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund
```

Cloudra never runs npm during execution or server startup. Missing Node or dependency makes `javascript` runs (the default protocol) report `runtime_unavailable` with no silent fallback; `traditional` runs need no JS dependency at all. For an installed (pip) package, run the same command against `<site-packages>/cloudra/runtime_v2/js_host`.

### Security boundary

The supported threat model is a **local single-user runtime** containing untrusted generated JS within QuickJS-WASM, a killable process, and a hostile-input-checked bridge: 64 KiB source cap, bounded JSON-lines transport, 1 MiB tool-result cap, CPU interrupt checks, a 15 s idle watchdog, `--max-old-space-size=128` (a V8 heap hint, not an OS RSS limit), minimal environment, and a fixed cwd outside user workspaces. This is **not a hardened multi-tenant OS sandbox**: Node/engine vulnerabilities are residual risk, and minimal cwd/env cannot stop a compromised host from reading files. OS-level sandboxes/containers are explicitly out of scope — do not run programs you would not trust on this machine.

## Quantum Chemistry & HPC Integration

Cloudra seamlessly bridges local exploratory modeling and remote cluster computing:

- **Electronic Structure Engines**: Integrates with Gaussian, ORCA, xTB, CREST, VASP, and CP2K for automated input preparation, local process execution, and Slurm batch submission.
- **Cheminformatics & Property Analysis**: Connects with RDKit, OpenBabel, Multiwfn, and Molli for 3D geometry manipulation, NMR/IR spectral simulation, stoichiometry verification, and high-fidelity CDXML reaction parsing (stereochemistry, connectivity, charge, and multiplicity preserved).
- **Literature & Academic Authoring**: Direct integration with OpenAlex for literature search and automated Markdown/LaTeX report generation with full level-of-theory annotations.

Root configuration, license/citation files, `install.sh` and `web.sh` remain in place; temporary runtime and build outputs are ignored. Application deliverables and presentation workspaces are no longer tracked; earlier copies remain in Git history.

---

## Development & Testing

Run syntax and lint checks, then the tests for the changed modules. The complete suite runs in CI; do not run it routinely for a local change.

```bash
uv run python -m compileall -q cloudra tests
uv run ruff check cloudra tests
uv run pytest -q tests/test_dag_engine.py        # Example: DAG engine changes
uv run pytest -q tests/test_runtime_v2_replay_equivalence.py  # Example: recovery changes
```

Benchmark verification and native-evidence replay are described in the [benchmark guide](cloudra/benchmark/README.md). Native evidence must first be restored from the [Drive release](gold_compute/evidence/DELIVERY.md) for log replay; ordinary source/unit checks do not require an automatic cloud download.
