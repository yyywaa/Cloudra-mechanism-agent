# K-Dense scientific-agent-skills (molecular-dynamics) and license

The `molecular-dynamics-simulation` skill is adapted from the `molecular-dynamics` skill of
[K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills),
MIT licensed, Copyright (c) 2025 K-Dense Inc.

- Adapted path: [`cloudra/skills/molecular-dynamics-simulation/`](../../cloudra/skills/molecular-dynamics-simulation/)
- Upstream skill: `skills/molecular-dynamics/`
- Upstream license: MIT

Cloudra's copy is substantially extended: the upstream skill is written around OpenMM and
MDAnalysis, while the Cloudra version re-anchors the workflow on the Cloudra toolchain
(GROMACS / AMBER / CHARMM, `submit_compute_job`, the local analysis wrappers) and adds
force-field pairing, ion-model and thermostat guidance. The OpenMM and MDAnalysis
implementations in sections 4 and 5 of the skill remain derived from upstream.

The provenance was recorded in the skill's frontmatter when it was first adapted, but was
dropped during the skill rewrite in commit `27931d88` ("feat(skills): upgrade
first-principles, literature, docking, md, and subagent skills"). It was restored on
`metadata` in the skill frontmatter and recorded here.

**How to keep this from recurring:** when a skill is adapted from an upstream source, the
upstream project, upstream path, license and copyright line belong in the skill's
frontmatter `metadata` block, and the full upstream permission notice belongs in this
directory. Editing a skill's body must not drop that block.

The upstream MIT permission notice is preserved below.
