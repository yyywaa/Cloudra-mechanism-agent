# TS search playbook

The engine recipes below describe scientific methods. Prefer `ts_prepare`/`ts_resume` for formal TS solving and complete verification. Direct TS/IRC submissions are for exploratory trials or capability probes only; ordinary exploratory scans remain available. Return candidate XYZ files through `guess={kind:"provided",xyz_path,evidence_refs}` and eligible existing IRC through `verification.irc_log` with its provenance checks. If blocked, inspect and revise the named declaration rather than bypassing the process. Native scientific checks and DAG evidence binding remain required.

How to get from "we know the step" to a validated first-order saddle point, without burning the queue. The doctrine in one line: **convergence is decided by guess quality and Hessian quality, not optimizer settings** — the best-documented replays after failure are physical (new conformer, new path, better endpoints), and IDPP-class guesses cut MEP-search cost by half or more relative to naive interpolation.

## 1. Seed hierarchy (use the highest rung that fits)

1. **`ts_prepare` process** — declare grouped reaction, explicit conformer/guess sources and independent methods; it builds/maps/assembles/guesses/validates/submits/refines autonomously. `blocked` names the offending declaration; fix and `ts_resume`.
2. **Mapped interpolation → NEB** — endpoints optimized at the same level, atom numbering aligned 1:1, all-atom map complete. `ts_guess mode=interpolate` with **IDPP** (distance-space interpolation; never Cartesian-linear, which overlaps atoms and kills SCF). For ORCA, `! NEB-TS` (CI-NEB coarse → eigenvector-following refine) is the reference workflow; **NEB is the ceiling — QST2/QST3 are banned** (§2).
3. **Relaxed scan (1D or 2D)** — the workhorse when 1–2 internal coordinates describe the step. `ts_guess scan_prepare` (1–2 coordinates for Gaussian or ORCA; two-coordinate ORCA requires explicit `scan_mode="grid"` for an independent surface or `"concerted"` for a coupled path with equal step counts; higher-dimensional or direction-sensitive cases belong to NEB instead). Scan peak → **fresh unconstrained** TS job. The peak is a seed.
Use an available semiempirical method for exploratory PES scans within the user's current calculation requirements and budget (e.g. Gaussian PM7 or ORCA GFN2-xTB when supported). Only active Benchmark projects apply MethodPolicy, using the actual task policy; ordinary research projects have no default method/basis whitelist. Global configuration, examples and earlier tasks do not create a restriction. This is a choice of exploration level, not a last rung after expensive routes fail. Refine candidate regions at the agreed DFT level; low-level energies never enter delivered barriers.

For endpoint-based paths, check endpoint structures and atom correspondence. Exploratory scans can investigate an unknown endpoint; label their structures as candidates. A delivered path/barrier still needs the verified endpoints and comparable energies required by its evidence contract. Pre-orient complexes toward the hypothesized reactive pose.

## 2. Why QST2/QST3 are banned

QST interpolates a single quadratic transit curve between endpoint geometries and maximizes along it. It fails systematically when the "averaged" geometry is chemically meaningless (classic: HCN→CNH midpoint puts H inside the C≡N bond), demands identical atom ordering with no error if violated, and offers no path correction — a bad initial interpolation can only fail. NEB optimizes the whole MEP with a climbing image (correctable, resumable, exposes intermediates/multi-peaks); scans are cheaper and controllable when the coordinate is known. QST has no unique advantage — **do not write QST2/QST3 inputs, and do not revive them as a "quick try".** The ceiling is NEB.

## 3. NEB-TS practice (ORCA)

- `! NEB-TS` is the default one-shot (Loose-NEB-TS internally: CI-NEB to loose tolerances, then EF/P-RFO refine). `Fast-NEB-TS` (single NEB iteration → TS opt) is the budget variant; `ZOOM-NEB-TS` for long-tailed paths.
- Images: default `NImages 8` (excluding endpoints); 5–10 intermediate images per energy maximum. Do not inflate to dozens — convergence gets slower and less stable.
- After launch, **inspect the initial path** (`*_initial_path_trj.xyz`) before anything else: atom collisions and absurd bond cleavage show up immediately. `*_MEP.allxyz` enables restart.
- Cheap path pre-refinement: `Interpolation XTB2` or an xTB-level NEB-TS run first.
- NEB gives a **candidate**: still run freq (exactly one imaginary mode) and IRC before calling it a TS.

## 4. Scan practice (1D and 2D)

- **Choose the level before submitting.** `ts_guess scan_prepare` requires an explicit `method`. Favor permitted semiempirical methods for broad PES exploration, checking the target engine's availability and solvent/model support. If no suitable cheap combination is available, report that limitation and choose within the authorized scope; do not silently substitute DFT. If a profile is discontinuous or implausible, inspect the model and frame geometries before changing coordinates or methods. Refine a selected seed with a fresh unconstrained DFT TS job and verify its frequency and connectivity. A low-level peak is not a final barrier.
- Typical grid: 12–15 steps per coordinate; bond stretch 0.05–0.1 Å/step, dihedral 2–10°/step. Start from the equilibrium side, scan toward the forming/breaking direction.
- SCF struggling near the barrier top is normal (`SlowConv`-class settings are acceptable there).
- **When 2D is worth it**: two coordinates move concertedly (concerted double-bond shifts, proton transfer coupled to donor–acceptor distance), a 1D profile jumps/discontinues (another degree of freedom relaxed abruptly), or NEB initial paths keep collapsing. Cost is N² constrained optimizations (10×10 = 100) and results depend on scan direction/coordinate order — so confirm NEB cannot take the case before going beyond 2D. A diagonal alternative is a synchronous multi-coordinate scan (ORCA `Simul_Scan`), cost of one 1D scan but only the diagonal slice.
- Keep per-point `*.NNN.xyz` and the `*.relaxscanact.dat` sidecar for `scan_parse`; it reports the peak as a `candidate` with `scan_index`/`energy`/`geometry_ref` and never substitutes the last frame for a missing peak.
- Pass relevant software-native `watch_pairs` (Gaussian 1-based, ORCA 0-based) to `scan_parse` and inspect its per-frame `distance_table` alongside the energy profile and perceived connectivity changes, including hydrogen motion outside the scanned coordinate. Missing frames leave gaps in the audit. Distance-based connectivity changes are clues, not identified products or validated reaction paths.
- **The peak is a seed**: extract it, write a fresh input without any `Scan`/`Constraints` remnants, refine as TS.

## 5. TS refinement and the convergence ladder

Explicit setting examples; choose them for the diagnosed calculation rather than adding them automatically:

- ORCA: `! OptTS Freq TightSCF` + `%geom Calc_Hess true end` (exact initial Hessian; a model/force-field Hessian knows only positive curvature and cannot describe a saddle). Local mode → `Hess_Internal` from scan neighbors (ScanTS automates); delocalized/concerted mode → `Hybrid_Hess {reactive atoms}`.
- Gaussian: `Opt=(TS,CalcFC,NoEigenTest) Freq` explicitly requests these options. `CalcFC` requests an exact Hessian at point 1; `CalcAll` requests one at every step. Choose Hessian handling from the available data and native engine support. `NoEigenTest` suppresses mid-optimization curvature aborts; final frequency and reaction-mode validation remain required.

Cloudra does not force these solver settings. A TS stage supplies its basic `OptTS`/`Opt=TS`, `Freq` or `IRC` task only when no explicit native task was declared. User native options are retained, and questionable parameters appear in tool and TS-state `warnings`. Use the existing calculation fields and `ts_resume.changes` to revise them; a warning does not establish scientific validity.

When refinement struggles, climb in order:

1. **Check the followed mode first** (steps 1–5): ORCA prints the TS-mode composition — if it is not the intended coordinate, redirect with `TS_Mode {M n}` / `{B i j}` instead of burning more steps.
2. **Rebuild the guess** (closer scan peak, better conformer, NEB climbing image) — proximity to the saddle beats every knob.
3. `Recalc_Hess 5` (every 5 steps; value 1 only for truly pathological cases — it costs a full Hessian per step).
4. Small fixed step: ORCA `Trust -0.1`/`MaxStep 0.1`; Gaussian `iop(1/8=10)` or `Opt=MaxStep=10`, plus `Opt=NoTrustUpdate` if every step needs it.
5. Coordinate/Hessian-level moves: ORCA `TS_Active_Atoms`, `modify_internal`, `COPT`; Gaussian restart with `CalcFC` after 10–15 deforming steps, or `Opt=ReadFC` continuing from a freq chk.
6. Flat-PES numerical noise: `Tight`/`VeryTight` + `Int=UltraFine` (G09-era Fine grids make opt and freq convergence fight each other).
7. Still failing → change strategy (NEB-TS instead of single-ended refinement), or record the unresolved claim with the diagnosis. **Do not stack parameter tweaks onto retry #4.**

## 6. Soft modes and floppy/ionic complexes

H-bonded complexes, ion–molecule complexes, and long floppy chains give the Hessian near-zero positive eigenvalues; RFO steps then diverge and the optimizer oscillates forever (energy and RMS force plateau, steps pinned at the trust radius). Expect that **some of these TS searches cannot converge** — plan for that outcome instead of forcing it.

Regime moves, in order:

- Isolate the slack from the reaction coordinate: pre-optimize the encounter complex with only the reactive region free (`Constraints`/`ConstrainFragments`), freeze irrelevant floppy dihedrals during scan/NEB, release them for the final refinement.
- Keep fragments from flying apart: ORCA `%geom SPHEREPOT 2` / `BOXPOT` wall potentials; CREST `--nci`-style ellipsoidal walls for ensembles.
- Cheap curvature: GFN2-xTB Hessian first (`InHess XTB2` or read an xTB freq `.hess`), then DFT OptTS.
- Small fixed trust radius + frequent exact Hessian (approximate-Hessian updates are poor in soft-mode-dominated systems).
- Consider that the question may be an ensemble/loose-TS one: conformer ensemble + quasi-RRHO treatment of <100 cm⁻¹ modes instead of a single-structure answer.

## 7. Imaginary modes: chemical assignment is mandatory

A "TS" is delivered only when all hold:

1. Optimization converged by the engine's own marker (`THE OPTIMIZATION HAS CONVERGED` / `Stationary point found` with verified forces — never `ORCA TERMINATED NORMALLY` alone, never exit code 0).
2. Frequency at the **same level** (functional, basis, grid) shows **exactly one** imaginary mode. Multiple small imaginaries (≲50i cm⁻¹) are usually numerical noise or methyl rotors: re-optimize Tight+UltraFine and re-check rather than hand-waiving extras.
3. The imaginary mode's displacement **lives on the reacting heavy atoms** (the bond-making/breaking pair moving toward each other). If it sits on methyl rotation, loose torsions, or proton wobbles of a floppy ion–molecule complex, it is a **pseudo-saddle** — a conformational/complex-rearrangement saddle, not the reaction TS. Record as unresolved with the evidence. **Never judge a mode by its number alone**: `log_parser` on the frequency log returns per-imaginary-mode composition (`imaginary_modes`: top displaced atom pairs, heavy-atom fraction, and — when you pass the step's declared forming/breaking pairs as `watch_pairs` — the fraction of the mode on the claimed coordinate). Low watch fraction = the mode is not your reaction coordinate; respond to it explicitly (re-search or document the pseudo-saddle), do not wave it through.
4. IRC (or optimized endpoints from both IRC directions) connects to the intended minima; endpoint identities verified.

Start with a purposefully bounded bidirectional IRC, choosing its extent for the direction evidence needed, path topology and coupling, and compute cost; no universal count applies. Then optimize each outer frame without constraints at the same agreed model. Confirm minimum frequencies, endpoint identities and direction against the TS; keep native convergence status and label partial paths. Extend only when partial geometry still cannot establish direction or identity, not to satisfy a step count or intrinsic IRC convergence flag. The short path alone does not prove the full path or dynamics.

Magnitude sanity: |ν| ≥ 100 cm⁻¹ is a healthy saddle signal; 20–100 cm⁻¹ is usable but flags care with IRC and thermochemistry.

## 8. Failure bookkeeping

One-shot TS success is under half even in good pipelines; experts land ~3/4 of cases only after physical replans. Every failed attempt gets: the input kept, the failure class recorded (mode followed, wrong basin, SCF, pseudo-saddle, soft-mode oscillation), and the next physical move decided **before** resubmission. A failure without a recorded diagnosis is a promise to pay for the same compute twice.

### Automated scan continuation

With declared endpoints, call `ts_prepare` once with grouped `input`: `reaction`, optional local `calculations`, explicit `conformers` sources, typed `guess`, `ts_optimization`, independent `verification` calculations, and `execution`. A file conformer (`kind:"file"`) uses the external geometry as supplied; omitted or null `optimization` skips additional build-stage preoptimization. Formal TS, IRC and endpoint validation remain required. To clear an old preoptimization, use `ts_resume` with `changes:{conformers:{product:{optimization:null}}}` (or `reactant`); omitted source fields retain their values, and null clears an optional field. The program owns concrete structure correspondence: unique complete mappings are adopted automatically; inspect real ambiguity with `ts_inspect` and choose `reaction.selected_candidate` or call `reaction_mapping(run_id,selected_candidate)`. Do not copy atom maps or heavy-atom binding arrays between tools. A scan is `guess={kind:"scan", calculation:{engine,method,basis_set,keywords}, scans, freeze}`. A stage may explicitly select `{ref:"name"}` from `input.calculations`; references reuse complete settings, while each stage still selects its own level. `method` is one native token; put basis and keywords in their own fields, using `basis_set=""` for methods without a basis. Successful jobs advance automatically. `ts_inspect(run_id)` returns resolved planned configurations and immutable actual job snapshots, including scans. Use `ts_resume(run_id, changes, reason)` for later changes: omitted calculation settings stay, explicit empty values clear, engine/method/basis changes use `{replace:complete_configuration}`, and a changed reference uses `{replace:{ref:"name"}}`. A coordinate-only scan patch need not repeat calculation. Retry a failed attempt with `changes={}`, or change the scan, structures or guess to test another hypothesis. Previous attempts are retained automatically; no repair document is required. Running or cancellation-pending jobs require stopping before revision; affected queued jobs are withdrawn by the revision transaction. A scan peak remains a candidate requiring fresh unconstrained formal refinement and verification. Unknown-endpoint exploration may use standalone scans; direct TS/IRC trials remain exploratory, with candidates returned to the process for formal validation. Format 6 and earlier runs remain read-only with their historical inputs and jobs intact.

For an existing TS run, `ts_guess(run_id, mode="xtb_path")` or `mode="scan"` updates its guess intent through the same revision transaction and automatic compute queue; it does not start a separate runner. Existing scientific settings are retained, and a new path or scan must explicitly supply any required method or coordinates absent from the run. `mode="interpolate"` reads the run's confirmed endpoints, generates geometric images and submits the selected image as a provided guess through that same revision path; `mode="provided"` accepts a candidate path plus its source evidence. Run references inherit charge, multiplicity and execution resources; they cannot also override those fields or endpoint files. Standalone scan generation uses the same `charge`, `multiplicity`, `nproc` and total-job `mem` fields as `qm_input_writer`; declare charge explicitly for coordinate-only XYZ input. Independent interpolation/path analysis accepts explicit MOL/SDF endpoint graphs and resolves complete atom correspondence internally; do not copy an `atom_map` into `ts_guess`. Genuine ambiguity uses the reported complete `selected_candidate`; XYZ-only unidentified endpoints require a graph. Standalone scan preparation/parsing and diagnostic frequency/IRC evidence checks remain available without a TS run. A runner failure retains its original message and diagnostics; missing xTB uses the already ordered endpoints once for the explicitly labelled interpolation fallback.

The run's `frequency_analysis.mode_alignment` reuses the diagnostic from `ts_guess verify`. `misaligned` or `undecidable` asks the owning Agent to review the mode; it does not classify a pseudo-saddle or stop IRC automatically. The existing one-imaginary-frequency requirement remains in force. Review the recorded motion and reaction assignment, then decide whether to continue, call `ts_stop(run_id, reason)`, or revise the guess. Missing displacement evidence is reported as `missing`, never as zero reaction-center motion or a failed alignment.

Structure references (`reaction_center`, `ring_order`, `distance_filters`, and rotation atoms) always use 1-based full-structure numbers. Only native scan/freeze coordinates use the scan engine numbering: ORCA 0-based, Gaussian/xTB 1-based. `conformer_search`, `internal_coordinates` and `reaction_mapping` use 1-based numbers; subtract one only when supplying ORCA scan coordinates. Read the actual atom table from `ts_inspect` before revising references. Ring and filters work independently or together; both guide generation and qualify output. Ring shape labels describe final geometry and do not establish minima or TS validity.
