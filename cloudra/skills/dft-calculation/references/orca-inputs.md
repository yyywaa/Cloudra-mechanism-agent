# ORCA inputs for mechanism work

Use with the mechanism SOP. These recipes target ORCA 6.1 and the current Cloudra writer; check the installed version before using additional native options. Paths and the method/model are examples, not deployment defaults. Read generated inputs before submission.

## 1. What the writer actually translates

| Intent | `qm_input_writer` arguments | Expected ORCA content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Minimum optimization | `task_type=[{"opt":null}]` | `Opt` |
| TS optimization | `task_type=[{"opt":"ts"}]` | `OptTS` |
| Analytical frequencies, when supported | `task_type=[{"freq":null}]` | `Freq` |
| Numerical frequencies | `task_type=[{"freq":null}]`, `frequency_mode="numeric"` | `NumFreq`, no `Opt` or `Freq` |
| IRC | `task_type=[{"irc":null}]`, native `%irc` in `orca_blocks` | `IRC` and explicit IRC settings |
| Single point | `task_type=[{"sp":null}]` | Method/model only; no geometry task |
| External energy/gradient provider | `external_program`, `external_params` | `ExtOpt` + `%method ProgExt/Ext_Params`; method/basis suppressed |

The writer refuses unimplementable options instead of silently dropping them: Gaussian sub-options such as `calcfc`/`noeigen` on an ORCA task, unknown task keys such as `numfreq`, duplicate or conflicting task entries, and `frequency_mode` without a frequency task are all hard errors naming the native alternative. Put TS Hessian control in native `orca_blocks`; `extra_keywords` goes on the `!` line. A standalone frequency/SP is declared explicitly (`[{"freq":null}]` / `[{"sp":null}]`), never inferred from an empty task list. Successful writes return `interpreted_intent` (re-inspected from the generated text), an empty `unapplied_options`, and the generation path.

`end_setting` is Gaussian-only and rejected for ORCA; constraints/scans go into `orca_blocks`. A non-default `title` becomes an ORCA `#` comment; SMILES sources add an `expected_smiles:` comment marking a user-declared expectation — never label an unverified structure as identity-matched. When delivery/benchmark evidence binding requires it, the agent still ensures a `smiles: <SMILES>` annotation line on inputs/logs (canonical delivery form). `mem` is the job total; ORCA `%maxcore` is written per-core (`mem/nproc`), so request `memory_mb` equal to the total when submitting.

## 2. Complete external TS example

Assume a checked singlet anion candidate and an installed external program/model. Use the actual candidate XYZ, not a new SMILES embedding. A fresh input avoids inheriting scan constraints.

```json
{
  "engine": "orca",
  "source_type": "xyz_file",
  "source_value": "/work/e1/candidate.xyz",
  "method": "",
  "basis_set": "",
  "external_program": "/opt/chem/bin/mace",
  "external_params": "--model /opt/models/mace.model --device cpu --dtype float64",
  "task_type": [{"opt": "ts"}],
  "charge": -1,
  "multiplicity": 1,
  "nproc": 1,
  "mem": "3GB",
  "orca_blocks": "%geom\n  Calc_Hess true\n  NumHess true\n  MaxIter 100\nend",
  "output_dir": "/work/e1/ts.inp"
}
```

Expected controls: `! ExtOpt OptTS`, `%pal nprocs 1 end`, `%maxcore 3072`, the `%method` block, the `%geom` block, and `* xyz -1 1`. There must be no `Scan`/`Constraints`, `Freq`, or default DFT method/basis in this external TS job. The 100-cycle limit is an example budget ceiling, not permission to remain in a wrong basin for 100 steps.

For DFT, omit `external_program/external_params`, supply the chosen ORCA method/basis (e.g. `PBE0`, `def2-SVP`), and use `TightSCF` plus a suitable DFT grid when needed. `Calc_Hess true` requests the initial Hessian; add `NumHess true` when an analytical Hessian is unavailable. Existing compatible Hessians can instead be read with `%geom InHess Read InHessName "...hess" end`. Check geometry, atom ordering and model provenance first. `Recalc_Hess` is a targeted response to a diagnosed Hessian problem, not a routine expensive addition. See [ORCA TS controls](https://www.faccts.de/docs/orca/6.1/manual/contents/structurereactivity/optimizations_TS.html).

## 3. Frequency and IRC follow-ups

After unconstrained convergence, use the final optimized XYZ. For an external provider without an analytical Hessian:

```json
{
  "engine": "orca",
  "source_type": "xyz_file",
  "source_value": "/work/e1/ts.xyz",
  "external_program": "/opt/chem/bin/mace",
  "external_params": "--model /opt/models/mace.model --device cpu --dtype float64",
  "task_type": [{"freq": null}],
  "frequency_mode": "numeric",
  "charge": -1,
  "multiplicity": 1,
  "nproc": 1,
  "mem": "3GB",
  "output_dir": "/work/e1/ts_freq.inp"
}
```

Expect `! ExtOpt NumFreq`. No optimization or old constraint block is needed. Inspect the full gradient and the displacement of the imaginary mode, not just its count. A prior Hessian at a different geometry is not final frequency evidence. Numerical differentiation requires smooth, reproducible gradients; retain native defaults until noise is diagnosed. Restart data must match the geometry and all model settings. See [ORCA frequencies](https://www.faccts.de/docs/orca/6.1/manual/contents/structurereactivity/frequencies.html).

Once that TS is validated, reuse its same-geometry frequency Hessian for both IRC directions:

```json
{
  "engine": "orca",
  "source_type": "xyz_file",
  "source_value": "/work/e1/ts.xyz",
  "external_program": "/opt/chem/bin/mace",
  "external_params": "--model /opt/models/mace.model --device cpu --dtype float64",
  "task_type": [{"irc": null}],
  "charge": -1,
  "multiplicity": 1,
  "nproc": 1,
  "mem": "3GB",
  "orca_blocks": "%irc\n  Direction both\n  MaxIter 80\n  InitHess read\n  Hess_Filename \"/work/e1/ts_freq.hess\"\nend",
  "output_dir": "/work/e1/ts_irc.inp"
}
```

`MaxIter` is a ceiling. A genuinely converged shorter path does not need padding. Without a reusable Hessian, `InitHess calc_numfreq` requests numerical evaluation; do not inadvertently request an analytical external Hessian. Native files include `ts_irc_IRC_F_trj.xyz`, `ts_irc_IRC_B_trj.xyz` and the final `ts_irc_IRC_F.xyz` / `ts_irc_IRC_B.xyz`. Preserve them with the main log. See [ORCA IRC options](https://www.faccts.de/docs/orca/6.1/manual/contents/structurereactivity/irc.html).

For each outer frame, use the same model with `task_type=[{"opt":null}]`, no constraints, then check minimum frequencies and identity. Forward/backward are trajectory labels, not guaranteed reactant/product assignments. `log_parser` reads native ORCA IRC counts/convergence; `ts_guess strict=True` extracts path endpoints from the native `*_IRC_F.xyz` / `*_IRC_B.xyz` final endpoint files (falling back to the last frame of `*_IRC_F_trj.xyz` / `*_IRC_B_trj.xyz`). A direction that terminated without converging keeps its path gap open — this is not a point-count issue; a short but converged path needs no padding. Use the SOP's evidence/limitation procedure, not repeated compute.

For free energies, read `method-selection.md` §4: `log_parser` supports ORCA thermochemistry fields, but the current `thermo_analysis` raw-RRHO adapter is Gaussian-only. For a requested electronic barrier, use the validated electronic energies directly.

## 4. Relaxed scan example

`ts_guess scan_prepare` uses a different schema from `qm_input_writer`: `spin`, `nprocs`, combined `method`, and raw external `%method`. Its public atom indices are **1-based**; the generator converts to ORCA's **0-based** indices. The example scans atoms 1 and 9; choose real indices/range from the structure.

```json
{
  "mode": "scan_prepare",
  "engine": "orca",
  "input_path": "/work/e1/reactive.xyz",
  "scans": [{"coord_type": "bond", "atoms": [1, 9], "scan_end": 1.30, "scan_steps": 16}],
  "method": "ExtOpt",
  "charge": -1,
  "spin": 1,
  "nprocs": 1,
  "orca_blocks": "%method\n  ProgExt \"/opt/chem/bin/mace\"\n  Ext_Params \"--model /opt/models/mace.model --device cpu --dtype float64\"\nend\n%maxcore 3072",
  "output_path": "/work/e1/scan.inp"
}
```

Expect `! Opt ExtOpt` and `%geom Scan B 0 8 = <current>, 1.30, 16 ...`. The tool supplies `%geom`; do not append another scan/constraint block accidentally. The tool currently accepts only one scan coordinate for ORCA; for coupled two-coordinate scans write the multi-coordinate `%geom Scan` block explicitly via `orca_blocks`, or — usually better — switch to `! NEB-TS` (see `ts-search-playbook.md` §4 for when 2D is worth it and §3 for the NEB-TS recipe). For DFT use ORCA-native spelling in `method` (e.g. `PBE0 def2-SVP`), without the external block. `scan_prepare` has no memory field; set `%maxcore` through `orca_blocks`.

Keep `<stem>.relaxscanact.dat` and per-point `<stem>.NNN.xyz` files for `scan_parse`. Its native sidecar path pairs energies with the correct frame and reports the peak as a `candidate` with `scan_index`/`energy`/`geometry_ref`/`source`. If the peak frame file is missing, the tool returns `candidate_unavailable=true` and never substitutes the last frame; recover or re-run the missing frame before extracting a TS guess. The text-only fallback is best-effort: inspect the returned notes before using it as a peak candidate. Export the chosen seed into a fresh unconstrained TS input.

## 5. Submission and failure checks

For the one-core examples, submit the actual generated path with `job_type="orca"`, `cpus=1`, `memory_mb=4096`, `is_async=true`. Writer `mem="3GB"` is a total budget divided by `nproc`; ORCA `%maxcore` is per process. Reserve memory for all processes plus overhead. `%maxcore` does not cap the external ML model's memory. Use the node's real capacity, not a fixed atom-count/core rule.

Use separate basenames/directories for independent jobs to avoid scratch/Hessian collisions. Check the original input and final geometry alongside `log_parser`: `ORCA TERMINATED NORMALLY` can also appear after an optimization reaches its iteration limit. For `ExtOpt`, absent SCF blocks are expected; lack of cclib SCF data is not by itself a failed external job.

`ExtOpt` replaces the energy/gradient provider; it does not select a TS task and does not expose DFT orbitals. Do not add `SCF=...`, Gaussian `Int=UltraFine`, `NoEigen`, `LQA`, or `Geom=AllCheck`. Native DFT controls cannot repair a rough external potential. See [ORCA external interface](https://www.faccts.de/docs/orca/6.1/manual/contents/structurereactivity/optimizations.html#external-programs).
